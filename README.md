# Markdown Writer

Minimalist themes for writing markdown. There are two variants: `light` and `dark`. Each variant is controlled by three customizable color settings: `foregroundColor`, `backgroundColor`, and `accentColor`.

This theme was built for my own needs. Notice an issue or anything missing? Feel free to open an issue or make a pull request!
