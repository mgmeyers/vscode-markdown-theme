# Markdown Writer

Minimalist themes for writing markdown. There are two variants: `light` and `dark`. Each variant is controlled by three customizable color settings: `foregroundColor`, `backgroundColor`, and `accentColor`.

This theme was built for my own needs. Notice an issue or anything missing? Feel free to open an issue or make a pull request!

## Examples

Here are some of my favorite eye-friendly color combos taken from the [Noctis themes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liviuschera.noctis)

[Input Mono Narrow](https://input.fontbureau.com/preview/?size=14&language=python&theme=solarized-dark&family=InputMono&width=300&weight=300&line-height=1.2&a=ss&g=ss&i=0&l=0&zero=0&asterisk=height&braces=straight&preset=default&customize=please) is the font used in all screenshots below
